                            What is the difference between the SAT and ACT?

                            <p>The SAT focuses more on reasoning and problem-solving, with sections for Reading, Writing and Language, and Math. The ACT assesses curriculum-based knowledge, covering English, Math, Reading, and Science, with an optional Writing section. Many colleges accept either, so choosing the right test often depends on a student's strengths and preferred question styles.</p>

                            <p>The Secondary School Admission Test (SSAT) is a standardized test used for admission to independent elementary, middle, and high schools. It assesses quantitative, verbal, and reading skills appropriate for students in grades 3-11. If you're applying to private schools, the SSAT is often a required component of your application.</p>
