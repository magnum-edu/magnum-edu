                            <p>Ms. Atkinson has had such a positive impact on me, especially in high school when I needed some extra help in math but she’s so much more than a tutor. She’s someone I could always talk to about anything and who helped me in every way she could. Even when she stopped working at my high school, I continued a relationship with her because she knew how I learned and she was able to explain things in a way that I understood. She really took the time to understand how I process information and made it so I found it way easier than the way my teachers explained it. In the past I have had tutors who made the sessions boring and I would dread going too, but I looked forward to going to tutoring with her not only because of how beneficial it was but because of her positive and upbeat personality!</p>

                            <p>Laura was an incredible help during my college math classes. I always felt completely comfortable working with her, and she helped me feel more confident after every session. She adapted so well to my learning style and needs, making complex topics much easier to understand. Thanks to her support, I was able to meet my academic goals. I highly recommend her to anyone looking for a patient, knowledgeable, and supportive tutor!</p>

                            <p>Laura is an experienced and talented educator who works hard to understand her students and how they learn so that she can meet their educational needs. I worked with her for years and saw how dedicated she is to not only teaching the subject material, but also building a relationship with her students and guiding them towards a successful future. She is certified in multiple subject areas and experienced in preparing students for SAT/ACT examinations. Laura will work hard to ensure that your child gets the one on one tutoring that they deserve and the valuable counseling to prepare them for their future.</p>

                            <p>Working with Laura Atkinson has been an absolute game changer for my son. Not only did she help him improve his grades in his classes, she also helped him with his organizational skills. Laura’s support during the college application and enrollment process was also great, and it felt like a huge burden was taken off my plate. I can’t thank Laura enough for her dedication and expertise!</p>

                            <p>Ms Atkinson is more than just a teacher. She is a mentor. She has a unique ability to help her students understand what they need and then advocate for themselves. She has given students the ability to rely on someone, to help them develop their plan and/or strategy for learning more efficiently, confidently, so they can be accountable. To summarize, Ms Atkinson is the type of teacher that makes a lasting impression on her students; the kind of impression that students (and parents) go back to the school just to say "thank you".</p>

                            <p>I had the pleasure and privilege of being a student of Ms. Laura Atkinson from 2014-2016. Laura is an exemplary professional in education, due to her commitment to the quality of her learners’ educational experience. She fosters a truly supportive classroom environment where students feel empowered to participate in discussions, make connections with their peers and seek deeper understanding of content. Laura is an asset to any institution she may work at in the future, and I can personally say that my interest in several academic subjects can be accredited to this committed, engaging and knowledgeable educator.</p>

                            <p>I cannot recommend Laura Atkinson enough! She was my favorite teacher in high school—not just because of how amazing she is at teaching, but because of how much she truly cares. She always went above and beyond to make sure I understood the material and felt supported, both academically and personally. Her compassion and patience made a huge difference in my life. She helped me find my love for psychology! Now that she’s starting her own tutoring and college counseling business, I know so many students are going to benefit from her incredible guidance, knowledge, and kindness. If you’re looking for someone who truly understands how to support students academically and emotionally, Laura Atkinson is the person to go to.</p>
